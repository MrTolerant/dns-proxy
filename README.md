# DNS to DoT Proxy

## Overview

Written using Python language proxy forwarding DNS queries over TLS for secure
- private communications.

It listens on port 53, directing queries to Cloudflare's DoT endpoint (`1.1.1.1:853`)

## Security concerns

Key concerns include:
 - the need for root access for binding **53** port
 - ensuring TLS security
 - managing query log privacy
 - protecting against DoS attacks.

## Integration for microservices architectures

- **Containerized** with Docker for easy deployment.
- **Kubernetes** deployment can easily use docker image builded using Dockerfile

## Proposed improvements

- include DNS query caching
- integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus
- enhanced security measures (IP filtering, rate limiting).

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- docker-compose

### Instructions

1. Build and Deploy: `docker-compose up --build`
2. This stack mapping host port ```5553``` to container port ```53``` for testig purposes, because for binding ```53``` port you need root privileges

### Testing

Configure DNS client to use ```localhost``` as DNS server and use **TCP** queries

**Example**:
```
dig @localhost -p 5553 +tcp wwww.com
dig @localhost -p 5553 +tcp google.com
dig @localhost -p 5553 +tcp n26.com
```

you should see something like:
```
‚ùØ dig @localhost -p 5553 +tcp wwww.com

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @localhost -p 5553 +tcp wwww.com

And inside docker logs you will see:
